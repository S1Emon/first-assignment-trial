                <p>
                    I strongly believe that "Life is like a camera, Focus on the Important Things. Capture the Good
                    Moments.
                    Develop from the Negatives & If things don't work out Take another Shot!"
                    So, my mission is to become a best web developer.

                    The main objective when being as a developer is to be dedicated and practice time to regular
                    life. Specific goals need to be set, which is: Enhancing learing skills, Tracking time, and Working
                    very hardly.
